# Getting Started with Copy One Thing React App

Hi, I am Winson Lee.ðŸ‘‹

This project is a clone of coding-in-public's 'one thing react app' with some different fretures.

I inited this project using react-app-script, not vite. So you will find it quite slow while downloading packages. Don't worry,just a demo ~

## How to use ?

Download this repo then,

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


Here is a [demo](https://onething.winson.dev/) hosted on Vercel.
